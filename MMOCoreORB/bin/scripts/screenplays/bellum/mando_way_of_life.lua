-- ============================================================
-- Mandalorian Way of Life
-- Branch: Ender_MandalorianWay
-- Spec: mando_way_of_life_spec.md v1.0
--
-- Lua-first | Minimal C++ | Pre-CU Authentic | BG Rules Compliant
--
-- C++ hooks live in:
--   MissionManagerImplementation.cpp     (Patch 1 - tag BH at accept; optional, completion no longer depends on it)
--   MissionObjectiveImplementation.cpp   (Patches 2 & 3 - count NPC BH on complete; Foundling planet tracker message)
--
-- --- AiAgent options: AIENABLED (project convention) ---
-- AIENABLED is OptionBitmask::AIENABLED (0x00000080) in src/templates/params/OptionBitmask.h.
-- Lua globals AIENABLED, CONVERSABLE, INVULNERABLE are injected by DirectorManager / CreatureTemplateManager
-- (same numeric values as C++ OptionBitmask).
-- CreatureObject:setOptionsBitmask(bits) REPLACES the whole mask, it does not OR with the creature template.
-- So any post-spawn script that sets the mask must list every required bit. For Bellum quest NPCs that use
-- radial "Converse", use AIENABLED + INVULNERABLE + CONVERSABLE unless a case intentionally disables AI
-- (document that exception inline). AiAgentImplementation gates various AI/conversation paths on AIENABLED;
-- CONVERSABLE is the Lua name for the CONVERSE bit (0x08).
-- Shared setup for Foundling informant mobiles: configureFoundlingInformantMobile() below.
